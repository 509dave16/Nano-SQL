# Examples Readme

## Big Picture
The examples are designed so you can start a server in the examples directory and navigate to the different folders to see the examples in action.

## Step By Step
You can just run this command from the root of the "examples" folder:

`npm install http-server -g && http-server`

You can now get to the examples in your browser by going to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

If you used the method above or your server is running at localhost on port 8080, the links below will take you to the respective examples.
